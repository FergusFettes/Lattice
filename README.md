Lattice Model Simulations

The goal is to make a little app for visualising different lattice models. Initially, there won't be any of the good analysis stuff that physicists normally do with these models-- to a computational physicist this work makes basically zero sense. But the analysis is computationally expensive and time-consuming-- to start with this is just a visualisation app.

The models that I will be starting with are:
-- Ising & Potts
-- Conway's GoL and Cellular Automata

Ideall I would later move on to do some nice Eden model simulations and maybe some evolutionary dynamics (Prisoners Dilemma etc.)

If it works out, I will also be trying to 'gamify' some of the models, or at least make them interactive (so you can paint into them and so forth). We'll see how that goes. And once I have a decent handle on moving pixels around I can perhaps start to experiment with mixtures of models etc. etc.
